	(21,'2009-06-21','release_info',1,'Version 3.1 Web Tool Upgrades','**The Roadmap Drawings feature of the Web Tool received major feature upgrades Sunday, June 21, 2009**. //POST Drawing features were not affected by this upgrade.//\r\n\r\n**Introduction**\r\nThis upgrade is different than other upgrades with new features and bug fixes. Here\'s why. As Oregon\'s unemployment rate has risen and the number of job seekers has exploded, the need for occupational information has expanded as well. In order to assist job seekers across the state, leaders at our Employment Dept. and Worksource Oregon centers expressed an interest in being able to see Career Pathways Roadmaps by occupational area and not have to search every community college website to find a specific program. To do this, we are now linking all published Career Pathways Roadmaps on the Occupational Report in OLMIS.\r\n\r\nWhen a job seeker or staff person goes into an Occupational report on OLMIS at the top of the page will be a link for \"Career Pathways Roadmaps\". When the user clicks on this link, a list of links of all of the available community college roadmaps will be listed.\r\n\r\n**Benefits**\r\nYour community college roadmaps will now be available on OLMIS giving job seekers around the state the opportunity to learn about your program. The added benefit to you is that prospective students browsing careers options on the OLMIS website will now be able to link to roadmaps for the community colleges offering degree and certification programs in their field of interest. \r\n\r\n**Changes You\'ll See**\r\n* **Standardized roadmap drawing titles.** This has been done to help avoid typographical errors and maintain consistency in the roadmap titles, following the list of approved career and technical education programs in the Oregon Community College Viewbook, January 2009. For instance, we have seen variations in how roadmaps have been named for the EMT program, such as EMT Emergency Tech, Emergency Med Technician, and Emergency Med Technology.\r\n* Where applicable, we have matched roadmaps to the list of Approved Career & Technical Education Program in the Community College Viewbook. The roadmaps are also now also sorted by Oregon Skill Set.\r\n* We recognize that many of your roadmaps are not yet listed in this approved program list, or you may title your program something other than the approved program name. Don\'t worry! If your program fits into an approved program category, you can continue to specify an alternate title, which will be used as the roadmap title, like before. If no alternate title is provided, the approved program name will be used instead. And if your program is \"not listed\" in the approved program name list, you can use the alternate title to state your program name like before. It\'s that simple!\r\n* In addition, through the Drawing Properties screen for your published roadmaps, you can now add **OMLIS links** by either searching your roadmap for URLs you may have added to OLMIS occupational report pages, or by manually adding OMLIS URLs. A simple click on a checkbox next to the desired occupation listing will allow that roadmap to be publicly accessible on the OLMIS website for that occupation.\r\n* **NOTE**: the folks at OLMIS and the Oregon Employment Department are currently finishing up the programming on their end. As soon as that is tested and ready to release, you will get an email letting you know how roadmaps will be displayed.\r\n\r\n**How You Can Help**\r\nAs with any new change, there may be glitches, and we encourage your to check over your roadmaps to ensure the titles look the way you want. And as always, we welcome your input and feedback. Please use our automated **Help Desk** to submit your feedback and questions.\r\n\r\nTutorial revisions specific to this upgrade are for **Roadmap Drawings only**:\r\n* [http://cpwebtool.org/tutorial/Roadmap_Drawing_Properties Roadmap Drawing Properties]\r\n* [http://cpwebtool.org/tutorial/Roadmap_Drawings#Adding_a_New_Drawing Adding a New Drawing]\r\n* [http://cpwebtool.org/tutorial/Roadmap_Drawings#Renaming_Drawings Renaming Drawings]\r\n* \'\'**NEW**\'\' [http://cpwebtool.org/tutorial/Roadmap_Drawings#Linking_to_OLMIS_Occupational_Reports Linking to OLMIS Occupational Reports]\r\n\r\nFor all other detailed step-by-step instructions on Career Pathways Roadmap Web Tool features, please refer to RESOURCES :: **Tutorial**. \r\n',1,0),

Always use the Print this Version tool feature to review your work for desired print layout.\r\n* **Color Palettes** have been updated to include \"white (#ffffff)\" as a standard color selection for all organizations. Some users have been using this color to creating floating box effects in their drawings.\r\n* **Drawing Properties** pages now provide an **External Link** reference based on where an individual Roadmap is embedded.

	(27,'2010-11-04','release_info',1,'Version 3.4 Web Tool Upgrades','As of **Friday, November 5, 2010** you will see and experience the following updates and improvements to the Career Pathways Roadmap Web Tool:\r\n\r\n**New Features**\r\n* **Roadmap Drawings, POST Views & POST Drawings - Print to PDF**: From the Drawing Properties page for Roadmaps and POST Drawings, as well as POST Views, you can now download automatically generated PDF documents of your published drawings! You also have access to a URL link that you can put on your website for viewers to download the same document. This PDF link will always generate a PDF of the most currently published version, rendered identical to your embedded drawings or published HTML link. **Read more here:** http://cpwebtool.org/tutorial/Print_To_PDF\r\n\r\n* **Improved External Links to OLMIS & MyPathCareers.org**: We are able to track links to embedded Roadmap Drawings and POST Views when you place the embed code (found in your Drawing Properties page) in your website. If the Web Tool detects an external link we are able to share that link with outside resources such as OLMIS and MyPathCareers.org, to direct outside traffic to your community college pathways websites! The improvements to this feature are in determining which link we share. If we detect multiple links (listed under \"Embed Views\" in your Drawing Properties page), you can now choose which external link you want as the \"primary\" URL. Or, you can simply copy and paste your preferred URL in the External Link field and save your changes. **Read more here**: http://cpwebtool.org/tutorial/Roadmap_Drawing_Properties#How_to_Edit_an_External_Link\r\n\r\n* **POST  Views & POST Drawings - Printing Legend Symbols**: Legend symbols are now drawn in an image tag instead of as a background image. This makes them print by default. End viewers are no longer dependent on enabling \"print background images\" with their browsers print settings to print correctly. \r\n\r\n**Bug Fixes**\r\n* **Published Roadmap Drawings - Links to OLMIS**: OLMIS uses two different domains for their full occupational reports. This has been causing a conflict in registering some links for published roadmaps since some users copy the second link format show below (olmis.emp.state.or.us). The Web Tool was original setup to only recognize the first domain shown below (qualityinfo.org). With this fix the Web Tool now supports both domains.\r\n * http://qualityinfo.org/olmisj/OIC?areacode=4101000000&rpttype=full&action=report&occ=111021&go=Continue\r\n * http://olmis.emp.state.or.us/olmisj/OIC?areacode=4101000000&rpttype=full&action=report&occ=111021&go=Continue\r\n * **Read more about using correct OLMIS Links here**: http://cpwebtool.org/tutorial/Roadmap_Drawings#Using_the_Correct_OLMIS_Links\r\n\r\n* **POST Drawings - High School Headers**: Added ability to hit enter on keyboard to save changes to High School POST Drawings column headings.\r\n\r\n* **User Account Profile**: Added the users Organization name to the user profile page, and corrected the drawings list display to reverse the order of versions keeping the most current version at the top of the list.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your feedback and thank you for your patience as we have worked hard to implement these changes.\r\n\r\n**Upcoming Features**\r\nRequests that did not make it into the above list are still in development, and will be completed in the near future. Here is a list of those pending requests:\r\n\r\n* **POST Drawings - Bug Fix**: Fix additional browser window/tab that is opening when attempting to edit content.\r\n\r\n* **Roadmap & POST Drawing List - Bug Fix**: Fix minor defects in filter box function and results.\r\n\r\n* **POST Drawings - Preview Rows & Columns Configuration Table**: Allow for a preview of table layout changes before saving the changes to the drawing. A new \"Save\" or \"Cancel\" button will be added before returning to the active POST Drawing.\r\n\r\n* **POST Drawings - Alternative Row Titles**: Add capacity to select from pre-determined alternative row titles:\r\n * Current row titles default to \"1st Year Fall\", \"2nd Year Fall\", \"Electives\", \"Prereq\", blank, etc.\r\n * We will be adding an approved list of alternative row titles for users to choose from, such as \"Term 1\", \"Term 2\", etc., \"Gen Ed\", \"Required\", and \"Core Req\"\r\n * \'\'If you have feedback on additional row titles that you would like considered, please submit your suggestions to helpdesk@ctepathways.org for review.\'\'\r\n\r\n* **User Permissions**: \"Org Admin\" and \"Webmaster\" users will be given the capability of adding and editing/managing users for their affiliated high schools.\r\n\r\n* **Affiliations**: \"Other Orgs\" (such as Lane ESD) will be able to add specific Community Colleges to their list of \"Affiliations\" so that they can create POST Views using their local community college\'s POST Drawings.\r\n\r\n----\r\nFor detailed step-by-step instructions on all Career Pathways Roadmap Web Tool features, please refer to our online [http://cpwebtool.org/tutorial Tutorials].
