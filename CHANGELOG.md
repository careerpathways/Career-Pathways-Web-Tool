* None

* Moves the Image Library “move” feature up above images, so it’s not too far off the screen when used.
* Updates permissions model for the Image Library. “If you uploaded it, you can modify it.”
* Updated help sidebar links styles to be consistent in Roadmap and POST edit screens.

## 4.1.4 (March 24, 2016)
### Config
* t192 - It might be necessary to tweak css on a per-project basis, for this to take effect. I don't think so but be aware.

### Release Notes
* Adds ability to move images to different buckets in the Image Library. [LL WA t72]
* Fixes Approved Program Name not showing up when adding a drawing to a view. [LL OR t193]
* Makes tools sidebar link styles consistent with other sidebar links. [LL OR t195]
* Updates default image library bucket to be user's school, except state admins (who default to the site-wide bucket). [LL WA t74]
* Updates post views, so Community College section tab names have the format: "DEGREE TYPE: POST Drawing Title" by default. High School tab names are unchanged. [LL OR t166]

### Additional Info
* When moving images in the image library:
* A user can move an image out of a bucket if they have the delete permission for that bucket (since they're essentially removing it from that bucket).
* A user will only see buckets that they are allowed to write TO, excluding the current bucket  (obviously). This causes a case where there are no buckets to move the image to, and that's expected/desired as far as I'm aware. I added a message that says something like "Sorry, there are no buckets available to move the image to".
