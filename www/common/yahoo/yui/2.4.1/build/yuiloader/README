   * Updated metadata for 2.4.1

2.4.0
   * NOTE: the API in this release has changed significantly.  Existing implementations
     will need to be modified in order to use the new version.
   * yuiloader now includes the yahoo and get components.  This removes the timing
     problems in the previous versions that forced one to use YAHOO_config or include
     yahoo.js on the page before yuiloader.
   * No longer uses YAHOO_config for loading, you must use YAHOO.util.YUILoader
   * Interacting with YAHOO.register or supplying a verifier function is no longer
     required to load non-YUI resources.
   * Supports script sandboxing.  Does not support x-domain sandboxing at this time
   * removed verifier property, added varName property which is only needed when
     using external scripts and the application needs to support Safari 2.x.
   * YUI metadata updates:
       * Added 'base', 'reset-fonts', 'get', 'json', 'simpleeditor', 'charts, and 'selector'
       * button and history are no longer beta components.
       * imageloader promoted from experimental to beta.
