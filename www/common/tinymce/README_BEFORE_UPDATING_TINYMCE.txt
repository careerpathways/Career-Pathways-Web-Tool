Most of TinyMCE is unchanged, however there are some plugins that are.
Be careful not to over-write these.

It's recommended to make a copy of the entire plugin, then upgrade tinymce, then put a copy back in place.


==jbimages==
The jbimages plugin is modified.

See Git commits 7a9326dd95c4312d98db36e3368ad7a7fd27ceff and bf854728f6c8985c60c3852f77b132fb8351172e to see major changes.
Other changes to this plugin are included in 4.1.0.

This plugin will very likely ''not'' be compatible with major version changes of tinymce.

TinyMCE has been upgraded to version 5, and jbimages has been modified further to make it compatible with the newer version.

jbimages was previously modified to allow each user to access a per-school library of images.
