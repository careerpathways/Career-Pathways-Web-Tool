Most of TinyMCE is unchanged, however there are some plugins that are.
Be careful not to over-write these.

It's recommended to make a copy of the entire plugin, then upgrade tinymce, then put a copy back in place.


==jbimages==
The jbimages plugin is modified.

See Git commits 7a9326dd95c4312d98db36e3368ad7a7fd27ceff and bf854728f6c8985c60c3852f77b132fb8351172e to see major changes.

This plugin will very likely ''not'' be compatible with major version changes of tinymce.
